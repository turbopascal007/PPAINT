1. Introduction
PowerPaint is a DOS-based paint program, written in Turbo Pascal 6.0
The source is 3800 lines long (1230 plus units: 696+83+895+200). Mouse, Crt and
DOS are excluded. We wrote it because we needed a paint program for DOS to
make drawings for games (Adlez, James) and when we made our own drawing
program, we could make anything we wanted (PAS & CPP format).
